<ul id="_296b8805-b152-49df-95fb-f229e5d8ab4a">
<li>
<p id="_982f5be9-e5f9-44d9-8358-55eabe1711d1">Characteristics of optical splices and connectors as well as other passive optical components that are needed to support outside plant applications (Question 7/15),</p>

</li>
</ul>
<p id="_2f5fc22e-f6ca-46b4-9363-6a4443d59fb4">Some of the specific subjects to be dealt with in the above four Questions are the following:</p>
<ul id="_d89db25d-1d37-4704-a586-fa659bb3e2f0">
<li>
<p id="_e5d01a0a-1bf2-4c42-941e-68283dd4eca9">Construction of all types of terrestrial cable for public telecommunications, including marinized terrestrial cables and the associated hardware (optical distribution frames, closures, connectors, passive optical components, street cabinets, boxes, poles, etc.),</p>
</li>
<li>
<p id="_73f36358-5e40-411b-bce7-b3c56ab6443c">Construction and maintenance of the telecommunication infrastructure. This includes interoffice, access and related building and home cable and hardware installations,</p>

<p id="_6ffc1da7-926e-4ac7-8e1c-fd11d61ac736">Moreover Questions 16/15 and 17/15, responsible for studies involving all physical aspects of outside plant, have extended their scope to also cover building and home installations, construction, installation and maintenance of the cable plant, including internal cabling and hardware for termination purposes.</p>
<p id="_3a5a9560-b006-4c88-b6b6-b31d22cbb129">Other subjects for study include reliability and security aspects, cable performance, field deployment and integrity of installations also for mixed transmission media, such as hybrid fibre/copper cables.</p>
<p id="_ce08d48e-d07d-480f-b4bf-4b567512c073">In this way, the complete chain of cables for interoffice, access and related buildings and home applications are standardized.</p>
<p id="_2f4e0c2a-5ebe-4ed6-ad45-9ce58e1a65bb">The activity on the construction of infrastructures addresses the investigation and standardization of all new techniques that allow faster, cost-effective and safer cable installation, also taking into account environmental issues such as the reduction of excavation, the problem for traffic, and the generation of noise.</p>
<p id="_a84b9d51-afee-4f26-b9c5-f1cff004da08">On request of developing countries, where creation of telecom infrastructure is underway to fill up digital divide, a particular effort has been devoted to the study of installation techniques in remote areas with lack of usual infrastructure, taking into account the mitigation of the considerable risks and/or issues to which the optical fibre cable may be exposed.</p></introduction></preface><sections>

Halstr&#246;m</strong> (Denmark), and with the following mandate "Protection and specifications of cable sheaths and poles".</p>
<p id="_ab4c74fd-83ac-43cc-a9fc-093224bd808e">In 1961 it was renamed as CCITT Study Group VI. In 1969, <strong>Mr J.R. Walters</strong> (United Kingdom) took over as chairman of the SG, followed in 1977 by <strong>Mr J. Pritchett</strong> (United Kingdom), and in 1981 by <strong>Mr K. Nikolski</strong> (USSR).</p>
<p id="_5d7b2458-d681-4d1c-88af-1edd825f1375">In 1985, the Study Group (SG) was renamed to "Outside plant", still under Mr Nikolski chairmanship.</p>
<p id="_5a41b9d8-0b9b-4649-a8df-eddc716aef3b">At the dawn of the CCITT era, the study group became ITU-T SG VI, and retained its title and chairman.</p>
<p id="_ac6a2aa1-37e8-44e0-885e-c0e1fd871492">In 1997, <strong>Mr Molleda</strong> (Spain) took over the chairmanship until 2000, when he was succeeded by <strong>Mr J.R. Osterfield</strong> (United Kingdom).</p>
<p id="_424ee55c-21b3-473e-9bb3-847ad085f14a">In 2001, according to the provisions of WTSA 2000 (Montreal), <strong>Mr F. Montalti</strong> (Italy) became the chairman of Study Group 6 that in 2005 changed its name to "Outside plant and related indoor installations".</p>
<p id="_54d8d554-4118-4f10-93e8-f2174ebd8159">In 2008, according to the decision of WTSA 08 (Johannesburg), Study Group 6 was disbanded and its activities were shared between Study Group 5 and Study Group 15. In Study Group 15 they were grouped in Working Party 2 under the Chairmanship of Mr. F. Montalti.</p>
<p id="_3ed67ac5-1dff-49aa-9629-32256f5a626c">In 2012 this organization was confirmed by the WTSA 12 (Dubai).</p>

This Recommendation describes characteristics, construction and test methods of optical fibre cables for duct and tunnel application. First, in order that an optical fibre demonstrates sufficient performance, characteristics that a cable should possess are described. Then, the method of examining whether the cable has the required characteristic is described. Required conditions may differ according to installation environment. Therefore, detailed conditions of experiments need to be agreed upon between a user and a supplier on the basis of the environment where a cable is used.<br/>

Optical fibre cables are traditionally used in trunk line networks, but their use is expanding rapidly to access networks. Today, many cables are buried in order to respect the environmental landscape, to reduce network construction costs or to reduce the extension of underground facilities like ducts and tunnels.<br/>
When they are installed without ducts, tunnels and hard protection, cables should have good resistance characteristics to harsh conditions. Some cables have strong outer armouring, others have outer pipe-systems or special plastic sheaths.<br/>

With the growth of fibre to the home (FTTH) services, there is an increasing demand for ducts and tunnels in which to install optical fibre cables. However, in metropolitan areas it is difficult to increase the number of ducts and/or tunnels because of the cost that it would involve and interference with traffic. Installing optical fibre cables in sewer ducts is one possible way to solve the duct shortage problem. However, the sewer pipe environment is different from that of ducts designed for telecommunication. Therefore, the required characteristics also differ from those for standard underground cables.<br/>
This Recommendation describes the characteristics, construction and test methods for optical fibre cables to be installed in sewer ducts and drainpipes. The characteristics that a cable should have for an optical fibre to perform appropriately are described. Also, a method is described for determining whether or not the cable has the required characteristics. The required conditions may differ according to the installation environment. Detailed test conditions need to be agreed upon between the user and the manufacturer concerning the environment in which the cable is to be used.<br/>
Amendment 1 to this Recommendation provides a new Appendix describing a national experience related to the subject. This Appendix, as the others in the main body of the Recommendation, may be useful for readers who intend to install optical fibre cables into specific sewer ducts (e.g., high water pressure and corrosive materials).</p>

<p id="_c552db66-da6a-4c39-bfa3-e5942198f86b"><strong>Optical fibre cable elements for microduct blowing installation application</strong> (03/2018)<br/>
Air blowing installation methods are based on viscous drag acting upon a cable within a duct by forcing a continuous high-speed airflow thorough the duct. The velocity of the moving air propels the cable causing it to advance at a typical speed supported by the blowing equipment.<br/>
When using blowing techniques, there is generally no pulling force at the front end of the cable. The airflow exerts a distributed force along the entire cable. In addition, connection to a pulling cord is not needed.<br/>
Generally, the blowing force is an order of magnitude lower than the typical force involved in other installation methods, for example pulling techniques, thus reducing installation hazards. Additionally, with this technique, bends in a duct run are of less concern than with pulling techniques, so generally, the installation speed increases, and longer lengths of cable can be installed. Cables are installed with low stress levels, leaving the cable or other elements effectively relaxed in the duct once the installation has been completed.<br/>
Therefore, cables can be designed with lower tensile capabilities than cables to be pulled. Elements without additional strength members&#8212;such as fibre units, micromodules, and single fibres&#8212;can also be considered.<br/>
New generation cabling techniques, based on microduct cables, microduct fibre units and microduct systems, offer the possibility of branching without the need for splices. These techniques are extremely flexible and make them possible to grow in accordance with demand. This gives rise to the concept of "fibre on demand", which involves the pre-installation of a multi-microduct system and then the subsequent, incremental installation of fibres based on individual customer demand.<br/>
To support this "fibre on demand" approach, a fibre cable product must allow the installation of only a few fibres at a time. These types of cable products should take up the smallest possible amount of the service provider's right-of-way (i.e., fit the smallest microduct) so that there is plenty of space to add fibres for future customers. Therefore, usually only a small number of the fibres that are installed are used immediately. The latest fibre technology can also be adopted when required.<br/>
This Recommendation describes characteristics, construction and test methods for microduct fibre units and microduct cables to be used with the blowing installation technique. The cable characteristics required for a cable to perform appropriately are described. Also, a method is described for determining whether or not the cable has the required characteristics. The required conditions may differ according to the installation environment. Detailed test conditions must be agreed upon between a user and a manufacturer for the environment in which a cable is to be used.</p>

Considerable experience has been gained using optical fibre cables in terrestrial and subsea applications showing that optical fibres provide a stable transmission medium and that there are situations where the concentration of hydrogen within a cable can rise to a sufficiently large value to cause the optical loss of the fibre to increase (see Appendix III). Therefore, there is a need to determine the build-up of hydrogen in a cable by considering the ways that hydrogen can be generated within it.<br/>
If the escape of hydrogen through the polyolefin sheath or the overlap of a moisture barrier balances the hydrogen generated in the cable, the resulting concentrations within the cable do not cause a noticeable change in optical loss (see Appendices I and II).<br/>

This Recommendation describes this trenching technique, which allows the easy installation, in narrow trenches, of underground optical cables and mini-cables in ducts or mini-ducts or directly buried. This type of narrow trench allows the use of reduced dimension machinery in small sized roads, typically those in cities, producing a lower quantity of waste material and so should be used in urban areas. This technology is mainly characterized by the simultaneous work of a suction machine and a trench saw, which allows for the possibility of opening and closing the work site the same day.</p>

<p id="_2b5642f5-a2d3-4803-afaa-3f000c89f9a7"><strong>Air-assisted installation of optical fibre cables</strong> (03/2018)<br/>
Air-assisted installation is based on forcing a continuous high-speed airflow along the cable with an air source. Moving air force pushes the cable and makes it advance forward at a typical speed supported by the equipment.<br/>
Generally, the tensile load on the cable is an order of magnitude lower than the typical force involved with other installation methods, like pulling techniques, reducing installation hazards. Additionally, with this technique, bends in duct run are not as important a matter of concern as they are in pulling techniques, so that installation speed increases and longer lengths of cable can be installed. Cables are installed without virtual stress, leaving the cable relaxed in the duct upon completion of the installation.<br/>
There are several variants of installation: with/without a piston at the front end of the cable, or with a leaking piston. For variants without a piston, there is no pulling force at the front end of the cable: air flow exerts a distributed force along the entire cable. In addition, the connection to a pulling cord is not needed.<br/>
This Recommendation describes air-assisted methods for installation of optical fibres cables in ducts. These methods can be used to install microcables or microelements into microducts, or jacketed cables into ducts or conduits. Installing conditions and equipment required should be different in each case.</p>

The current situation of the telecommunication market, and wide use of optical fibres as a transmission media, have contributed to the fact that some companies, apart from the incumbent telecommunication providers, like railway companies, have become interested in laying optical cables along their own infrastructures. These installations could be used for internal communications of the railway companies or be offered to other customers for public telephony.<br/>
On the other hand, telecommunication companies could use the railway facilities to provide telecommunication services to their clients.<br/>
Types of cable and infrastructures used in these installations can be very different.<br/>

The installation of optical cables inside sewer ducts is basically a trenchless technique.<br/>
Optical cable installation in sewer ducts presents many advantages compared with traditional trench installation techniques, such as: less time for cable laying, not limited by weather conditions, increased protection of cable against damage, no traffic disruption, no noise pollution, no excavation, no damage to road surfaces and underground installations, no heavy equipment, no inconvenience to businesses or to citizens.<br/>
In general, there are two categories of sewers: man-accessible and non-man-accessible sewers.<br/>
The definition of whether a sewer is man-accessible or not depends not only on national regulations, but also on the individual regulations of different sewer network operators.<br/>
This Recommendation describes methods to install optical cables inside sewer ducts. which applies to both the cable installation and the pre-installation of an infrastructure if requested. This Recommendation covers both man and non-man accessible sewer ducts. This Recommendation is not intended to address all the safety concerns, if any, associated with its use. Therefore, it shall be the responsibility of users of this Recommendation to establish appropriate safety and health practices and to determine the applicability of regulatory limitations, if any, prior to its use.</p>

Currently, very high broadband network, especially FTTH (fibre to the home) deployment, is a major challenge for operators. One of the main issues is the terminal part of the network with the introduction of optical fibre cables into building up to the apartment with technical difficulties but also administrative ones. This Recommendation deals with the solutions which could be deployed to try to answer to building owners, operators and customers' needs.<br/>
This Recommendation also refers to the single mode optical cabling in new and existing buildings. Clauses 5 and 6 explain the main constraints of a common optical infrastructure for several operators, offering FTTH services to customers in the same building. Then, the remainder of this Recommendation describes possible cabling solutions which could be deployed in buildings.<br/>
The proposed building cabling allows access to each operator to optical fibres in the building. The main goal of the concept is to be able to share the optical building cabling among different optical access providers.<br/>
The objectives are, on one hand, to reduce fibre installation and maintenance costs in the building (both at the customer premises and in the common parts) and, on the other hand, to reduce disturbance (noise, infrastructure works, dust, etc.) for inhabitants. The goal is also to avoid the possibility for an operator to somewhat "pre-empt" the optical link up to the customer in a building or to avoid cabling duplication if more than one FTTH operator is in a building.</p>

The quality of an optical network will be determined by the performance of each of its individual components. Nodes in this network are one of the key building blocks of the physical network.<br/>
A node occurs at each opening or end of a cable jacket. Examples of nodes are optical distribution frames, joint closures for underground and aerial applications, street cabinets, etc. Each node shall be capable of performing its expected function in the network, while exposed to the environment that it is intended to reside in. In order to obtain an end-to-end reliable optical network, it is, necessary to apply a consistent evaluation methodology for all the different types of nodes.+
This Recommendation defines the fundamental parameters that are relevant to describe passive optical node products in a systematically way and it is recommended to be used as a basis for generating performance requirements for passive optical nodes.<br/>
This Recommendation also summarizes the general requirements that are applicable for all types of passive nodes throughout the entire optical network.<br/>

Progress on multimedia technologies has led to the active development of many kinds of broadband services such as data and video communication using access networks. It is important that high-speed broadband networks be developed economically to provide such services to all subscribers. In order to provide these services in a timely way, it is necessary to construct optical access networks quickly, efficiently and cost-effectively. However, recent progress in the application of optical plant technology in local access networks has provided substantial technical and economical experiences in several countries. Considering this, the network design must take into account planning, construction, maintenance and operation.<br/>
The development of optical fibre access networks for broadband services can largely be divided into four stages based on the increasing number of customers; namely the initial stage, the growth stage, the mature stage and the final stage.<br/>
Here, an optical access network is defined as a network of optical fibre cables that extend from a carrier's central office to the cabinets, buildings, individual homes, apartment blocks or business offices for broadband services.<br/>
This Recommendation describes the optical access network to be used in the design and construction of fibre to the home (FTTH). It deals mainly with access network architectures and the upgrading or new deployment of optical fibre to optical access networks.</p>

Passive optical networks (PONs) are used to provide a fibre to the home (FTTH) service to subscribers in many regions and countries. The primary feature of a PON is that it realizes FTTH economically by sharing fibre access infrastructures, namely an optical line termination (OLT), fibre cable and branching component, between multiple subscribers. The branching component is one of the most important elements in a PON because its installation site has a powerful effect on both capital expenditures (CAPEX) and operating expenditures (OPEX). Therefore, the branching component installation site is an important consideration in designing this network. This Recommendation proposes considerations for selecting the location of the branching component in the network as a function of the scale of the subscriber density and geographical extent.<br/>
This Recommendation also describes considerations for determining the installation site of a (fibre optic) branching component in a PON designed to provide FTTH.</p>

HFC networks offer more chances of use as only pure networks for telecommunication or for cable television (CATV ) distribution. Additional services as Pay-TV, Pay-per-View, Video-on Demand, home-banking, -working, -shopping and Internet access can be offered by means of these networks.<br/>

In many countries, other licensed operators (OLOs) are allowed to compete with the incumbent operator. This creates an environment where a company must install, operate and maintain its network bearing in mind that other networks exist right beside it, or even at the same location. In several countries, it is also determined that the operators should share some parts of the network with OLOs, in a transparent process to the users. This is called unbundling of network elements or, in short, unbundling, and is a very complex task. Some new issues must be taken into account to allow the accommodation of those operators sharing the same location to do so without problems. To guarantee an environment where operators interact but do not affect the quality of service provided by other operators, legal, regulatory and administrative statements must be followed by the correct technical solutions, which assure the network integrity, easy use of equipment and access to security. This Recommendation is intended to provide the guidelines to achieve these targets for the local loop in copper networks.<br/>
In particular, this Recommendation describes a number of methods how network elements can be unbundled. Co-location is also described, as it is intrinsically related to unbundling.</p>

Placing cables in conduits is preferred because it has a principle advantage that the cable placement operation is separated in time from the actual conduit construction phase. The protection of the cable with the passage of time and the possibility of repeated access, cable removal and delayed cable installation make the method of placing cables in ducts more attractive. The method, however, has a disadvantage in that the initial cost of conduit construction is expensive. It is noted that underground ducts are prone to being deformed by the burden of earth pressure, which makes it necessary to check the ducts before cable installation, and to repair defective ducts before placing cables in conduits.<br/>
This Recommendation deals with inspection methods such as test mandrel and CCTV system to check duct quality, and it also describes various methods that are utilized to repair underground ducts.<br/>
Repairing methods by trenchless techniques are introduced and traditional repairing method is presented. Additionally, a guideline to select an appropriate repairing method is proposed.<br/>
This Recommendation is limited to the methods for underground ducts in which no cables are installed, and focused on the methods for underground ducts that have single-way duct unit systems.<br/>

Outdoor optical fibre maintenance is important to create networks and to maintain their reliability. As traffic increases, higher capacity fibre cables are installed. Recently, optical fibre cables with over 100 cores have become common, so many transmission systems use the same optical fibre cable. Minimal levels of maintenance and testing are required to provide high reliability and quick response.<br/>
After a cable is installed, functions like fibre monitoring and control must be done without interfering with the data transmission signals. By monitoring dark fibres (that is, without signal traffic) an indication is given of the performance of the in-service fibres as the degradation and breaks that a cable undergoes affects all fibres in the same way. Nevertheless, greater reliability is achieved by monitoring the fibres with traffic. Also, fibre identification is important to control fibre networks because several fibres may have to be chosen from within a cable, even if the cable has many fibres in-service.<br/>

Broadband optical access services are now commercially available. The number of FTTx subscribers is increasing rapidly. Trunk line communication traffic is also growing quickly due to the expansion of FTTx services. To meet the demand for increased transmission capacity, wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) and distributed Raman amplifier (DRA), technologies have been employed in trunk line transmission systems, and consequently high power communication signals and high pump powers have been introduced into optical fibre cables. If reliable optical cable networks are to be maintained, the study of optical fibre cable maintenance systems that can be applied to optical fibre cable carrying a high total optical power must be undertaken.<br/>
When DRA technology is applied to WDM systems, a high-power light is launched into optical fibres and fibre-optic components. The intensity of that optical power reaches several watts, and such a high-power light may induce damage in optical fibres or fibre-optic components.<br/>
During maintenance work, network operators must handle optical fibres or fibre-optic components carefully in central offices that employ high power systems with a view to preventing accidental eye or fire hazards.

Like other public infrastructures such as buildings, bridges and roads, cable tunnels are deteriorating. For example, cracks and water leakages happen and these phenomena degrade the safety and serviceability of the cable tunnel.<br/>
Notwithstanding how well a cable tunnel is constructed, it will require preventive maintenance to preserve its integrity and to prolong its life.<br/>
This Recommendation describes the needs and procedures of regular and detailed inspections. Typical inspection items are presented according to the type of cable tunnels and typical inspection technologies including non-destructive testing (NDT) are described.<br/>
Appropriate countermeasures against deteriorations such as cracks and water leakage are presented. Finally, the Korean experience is attached to Appendix I to provide examples of inspection frequency and comprehensive monitoring sheets for cable tunnel maintenances.<br/>

A telecommunication pole is one of the most important network infrastructures used to carry overhead telecommunication lines. In wooden poles, as support of communication lines, the wood, when the antiseptic efficiency of the preservative treatment has decreased below the threshold, is subjected to the attack of biological agents that cause its destruction.<br/>
Healthy wood of poles must preserve the mechanical strength that line security requires.<br/>
The heavy cost of wooden poles as well as of pole replacement requires conservation to extend the life of the poles, while paying sufficient attention to worker safety and the expected lifetime of the poles. This can be achieved by means of different systems such as reimpregnation, lowering, recover and reclassification.<br/>
Another material used in common utility poles is concrete. These poles are planted into the ground, but in some cases, they lean or are overturned by forces such as strong wind. This phenomenon is mainly due to a foundation failure.<br/>

Recently, natural disasters such as earthquake and flood have occurred more frequently. Outside plant facilities such as manholes and poles are occasionally damaged by these disasters, and as a result, telecommunication services are interrupted. In order to minimize damage and/or to protect outside plant facilities safely, appropriate disaster management is needed.<br/>
This Recommendation gives an overview of the technical considerations for protecting outside plant facilities from natural disasters. Disaster management for outside plant facilities such as cables, poles and manholes are introduced, and countermeasures for natural disasters such as earthquakes, strong winds and floods are described. In the appendices, Korean and Japanese experiences of disaster management are respectively introduced. Answers to a related questionnaire are also included to provide basic information about natural disasters around the world. The objective of this Recommendation is to share observations, knowledge, experiences and practices internationally, so that local engineering practices can be adopted to improve the disaster resistance performance of outside plant facilities.</p>

This Recommendation introduces an approach to improve network resilience against disasters and to assist network recovery after disasters by physically mobilizing units and facilities that package movable and instantaneously deployable resources for information and communication technologies (ICT).<br/>
The movable and deployable ICT resource unit (MDRU) is a collection of ICT resources that are packaged as an identifiable physical unit, movable by any of multiple transportation modalities, act as a stand-in (substitute) for damaged network facilities, and reproduce and extends their functionalities. The MDRU also brings extra ICT resources to meet the explosion in communication demands expected in disaster areas.<br/>
Focusing on the use of the units as a substitute for local nodes, this Recommendation reviews target objectives of disaster management and gives high-level requirements for both operations and facilities as a guideline. To shorten deployment time, which is the primary objective of network recovery with substitute, this Recommendation shows how to optimize the process that starts with equipment preparation in daily operation to service offering at the site of the disaster.</p>

Splices are critical points in the optical fibre network, as they strongly affect not only the quality of the links, but also their lifetime. In fact, the splice shall ensure high quality and stability of performance with time. High quality in splicing is usually defined as low splice loss and tensile strength near that of the fibre proof-test level. Splices shall be stable over the design life of the system under its expected environmental conditions.<br/>
At present two technologies, fusion and mechanical, can be used for splicing glass optical fibres and the choice between them depends upon the expected functional performance and considerations of installation and maintenance. These splices are designed to provide permanent connections.<br/>
This Recommendation deals with the application of splices of single-mode and multimode optical fibres. It describes a suitable procedure for splicing that shall be carefully followed in order to obtain reliable splices between optical fibres or ribbons. This procedure applies both to single fibres or ribbons (mass splicing). In addition, this Recommendation advises on the optical, mechanical and environmental testing methods required for the splice system design and equipment qualification.</p>

This Recommendation describes the external protection devices which can be utilized during/after the laying or during/after the reparation of marinized terrestrial cables (MTC). A marinized terrestrial cable is an underwater optical fibre cable, based on a conventional multi-fibre terrestrial cable core construction and protected to withstand the marine environment. It is designed for unrepeatered applications, that is, without underwater line amplifiers, hence without the need of power feeding for submerged equipment and has been tested for use in non-aggressive shallow waters, with a varying repair capability. The difference with respect to a repeaterless submarine cable can be found in the definitions given in ITU-T G.972.<br/>
Cables are designed with a predicted lifetime, taking into account either cable replacement or a certain number of repairs. For shallow-water cables, the probability of failures is higher than for deep-water application due to environmental phenomena (for example, sea-wave motion, underwater earthquakes and landslides, etc.) and human activities affecting the seabed (for example, fishing, laying and maintenance of other services and cables).<br/>
In addition to the various armour usually adopted for the cable construction &#8211; for example rocky armour (RA), steel wire armouring such as single armour (SA) or double armour (DA), additional external protections could be adopted if needed. Such protections can be applied both approaching the coast in shallow water and on shore in the portion between the water edge and the beach joint, or along the cable route where external factors or seabed features could damage the cables.</td>

This Recommendation describes the documentation/information that companies, involved in the installation, maintenance/repair of marinized terrestrial cables, should provide to the purchasers. In proximity of the landing points there are often many cables coming from various routes. In the shore-end portions, the cables and related protections such as burials, articulated steel pipes, etc. are closer and closer. Moreover, often the actual route is quite different from that foreseen as the laying reference route, as designed according to the various surveys, and the related documents are not updated. This situation could negatively affect subsequent installations and maintenance operations of cables and other services. In order to update charts, the national hydrographical institute, or any other local authority, has to be provided with the as-laid and as-built cable route information both after completion of the installation works, and after any repair if significant route changes occur. This will enable the proper design of project routes for future underwater services and cables and allow safe maintenance activities over existing lines so that overlaying and plants damage can be avoided.<br/>
The companies in charge of the installation of cables in shallow waters, especially close to the landing points of sea, lake and river shores, should provide the purchasers with an as-laid report after the completion of the work and a maintenance/repair log after any repair or replacement.</td>

A marinized terrestrial cable is an underwater optical fibre cable construction, based on a conventional multi-fibre terrestrial cable core protected to withstand the marine environment, designed for unrepeated applications, that is, without underwater line amplifiers, hence without the need to carry electrical power and tested for use in non-aggressive shallow waters, with a varying repair capability.<br/>
The difference with respect to a repeaterless submarine cable can be found in the definition given, for such a cable, in [ITU-T G.972].<br/>
The purpose of establishing uniform marking techniques and procedures is to facilitate repairs and restoration of telecommunications in the event of an accidental cable break or natural disasters. As such, markings and procedures contribute to the overall security of the MTC links.<br/>
This Recommendation describes the types of markers that can be applied on marinized terrestrial cables (MTC) and related land cables (considered as part of MTC) in order to warn of approaching joints, transitions and/or any relevant variation on the cable that can be useful for future inspections, cable protection and/or repairing.<br/>

<td valign="top" align="left"><strong>Splice closure for marinized terrestrial cables (MTC)</strong> (02/2004)<br/>
An important part of any installed underwater optical cable system is the jointing between different cable spans.<br/>
In fact, it is very important that a splice closure utilized for an underwater (i.e., MTC) optical cable system is manufactured in order to guarantee not only a good quality of transmission during the expected lifetime, but also cost savings for maintenance purposes.<br/>
A splice closure comprises a mechanical structure (closure housing) that is attached to the ends of two or more underwater cables, and a set of boxes (organizers) for containing and protecting the fibres and passive optical devices (if any).<br/>
As a rule, the closure housing and the armour terminations, generally designed for a whole MTC family, should be dimensioned for the strongest cable designed for that particular link (maximum tensile strength and maximum pressure resistance).<br/>
Splice closures for MTC applications may contain fibre splices, mass splices and passive devices.<br/>
Moreover, since such closures are typically mounted on the cable before it is installed, it should also be designed to withstand all handling and loads that occur during cable installation.<br/>
This Recommendation refers to both the design and the main characteristics that an underwater splice closure for MTC should have in order to be suitable for this application, as well as to guarantee the expected lifetime of the whole transmission link.<br/>
This Recommendation also provides the tests for characterization and evaluation of the underwater splice closures performance, including mechanical integrity and optical stability of the product simulating the effect of the environment (water), as well as interventions related to installation and network maintenance.</td>

Information about marine cable and pipeline installations can affect the cost of future installations or maintenance, including their environmental impact. At present, there is no global authority to maintain such information and the responsibility rests with individual countries. Given that information from multiple shoreline databases is necessary in designing new cable links, a standardization of the information that should be maintained will assist all participating parties. Such information is also useful in managing shoreline infrastructure when cables and pipelines are decommissioned, thereby allowing the possibility of reusing the space.</td>

<td valign="top" align="left">The use of underwater optical cables, considered as coming under the heading of terrestrial links, has dramatically increased in recent years.<br/>
This handbook describes the characteristics, including the installation methods and testing, of a particular type of underwater cable known as marinized terrestrial cable (MTC), which, based on a conventional multiple fibre terrestrial cable core, is protected to withstand the shallow water environment and designed for specific repeaterless applications.</td>

<p id="_99f0385d-f5c5-4be8-9735-ed2f3326daf7">Network resilience, and the robustness of the network infrastructure, should ensure the continuity of telecommunication services against any damage caused by disasters. Network recovery is restoration of the network infrastructure and telecommunication services to their original status or a certain level of availability, even temporarily, to provide the users with an adequate grade of services after the disaster.<br/>
This Supplement provides a framework of disaster management for improving network resilience and recovery (NRR) by reviewing high-level objectives of NRR against disasters, identifying several approaches (i.e., redundancy, congestion control, repair, substitute, and robustness) that meet the objectives, and clarify the approaches with regard to the effective time frame (i.e., phase) for disaster recovery. Based on the identified approaches with effective disaster recovery phases, information about relevant technologies, including already available ones and emerging ones, is also provided.</p>
