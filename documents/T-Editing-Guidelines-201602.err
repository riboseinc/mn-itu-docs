The recommended font is 8pt "Arial" for indicating URIs within the text. The recommended font is 9pt "Courier New" for ASN.1 modules and types, as well as for XML documents and schemas. Unless there are extenuating circumstances, no other special fonts should be used. (As a reminder, using the appropriate template for the particular type of document automatically implements all the special formatting if one selects the correct style for the elements within the document.)</p>

Greater consistency is needed in the way definitions are drafted. In addition, consideration needs to be given to ensuring that definitions are drafted in a way that allows for automated compilation and processing of new definitions so that the ITU database of definitions can be more easily maintained. Annex 2 to WTSA Resolution 67 (Johannesburg, 2008) provides basic guidelines for the preparation of terms and definitions. This annex builds on that guidance to help study groups to adopt a consistent approach to terminology and definitions and also to address the requirements for automated updating of the terminology database.</p>
